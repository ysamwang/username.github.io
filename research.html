<h4> Linear Structural Equation Models </h4>
<p class = "content">
My dissertation work with <a href="http://www.stat.washington.edu/~md5/Home.html" > Mathias Drton</a> focuses on interesting cases of linear structural equation models (SEMs) beyond the typical setting of Gaussian errors with a directed acylic graph. In an initial project, we consider SEMs with Gaussian errors which can be represented by a mixed graph-- a graph with both directed and bi-directed edges. In the graph, each variable is represented by a node, directed edges indicate that the parent has a direct causal effect on the child, and bi-directed edges indicates that there is latent confounding between two variables. We consider maximum likelihood estimation of parameters when the corresponding model may contain directed cycles or bows-- the case where two nodes which share both a directed and bi-directed edge.

<p class = "content">
More recently, I have been working on models where the errors may be non-Gaussian. Empirical likelihood (EL) provides a useful non-parametric framework for estimating model parameters without an explicit likelihood for the data, but comes at a high computational cost. We show how EL can be made more computationally tractable for models represented by a mixed graph. In addition, we consider exploiting non-Gaussianity for causal discovery. Specifically, consideration of higher order moments in the non-Gaussian case can be used to differentiate between graphs in the same Markov equivalence class. We exploit this fact to find a single graph (rather than an equivalence class) and are developing methods which are applicable in the high dimensional case (where the number of variables grows faster than the number of observations).

<h4> Mixed Membership Models </h4>
<p class = "content">
I also work on estimation of mixed membership models with  <a href="http://www.stat.washington.edu/elena/" >Elena Erosheva</a>. Mixed membership models are an extension of mixture models which allow each individual to belong to multiple sub-groups to varying degrees.

<p class ="center"><small>Estimated policy preferences for each identified sub-group</small> </p>

<p class = "content">
In a particular project, we consider mixed membership models of multivariate rank data, specifically Plackett-Luce models. Rank data can be used to express preferences over a set of alternatives. In particular, we analyze data from the Eurobarometer 34.1 survey in which participants ranked public health policy priorities for addressing alcoholism, illicit drug use and AIDS. The large size of the data necessitates an alternative to the typical MCMC approach so we develop a fast approximate inference method via variational approximations. We also extend the current literature by allowing for multivariate ranked data and explicitly estimating sub-group sizes.

<h4> Network Analysis </h4>
<p class = "content">
I am also collaborating with
<a href="http://octavia.zoology.washington.edu/" >Carl Bergstrom</a>,
<a href="http://www.stat.washington.edu/elena/" >Elena Erosheva</a>,
<a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/c3/" >Carole Lee</a>, and
<a href="http://www.jevinwest.org/" >Jevin West</a>
 on a cross-disciplinary project regarding homophily in co-authorship networks. Homophily is the tendency for individuals to associate with other individuals with similar characteristics. In particular, we are focused on measuring gender homophily in scholarly co-authorship, namely the JSTOR corpus. Measuring gender homophily is complicated by the fact that gender composition and co-authorship norms vary widely across disciplines and sub-disciplines. Thus, we use a non-parametric analysis which respects the network sub-structure and is capable of scaling to the 2.5+ million authorship records.
